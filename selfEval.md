# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
- **My time management is definitely an area that I am working on. I can be hyperfocused and have a hard time leaving a problem that I am struggling with. This can result in me spending 2+ hours more than expected and causing more unproductive struggle. In the CFUs, I have noticed that there are curve balls that require integration of new content and previously covered content. I appreciate support that allows me to verbally talk through the problem with a peer or leader to isolate the steps and move through the content easier. Also, content outside of Turing that students/leaders found useful is always much appreciated. Although I am still learning, I see the most progress when I set timers for myself and discipline myself to break and then come back to review the segment instead of just jumping back into the problem. This helps solidify what I already know but also I typically spot something that I was overthinking and then utilize that in my exercise. If I particularly struggled with an exercise, but found a solution, I will review the following day and the steps I took to make sure I really grasp how I came to that conclusion.**
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
- **A function is like a set of directions that you mark on a map that takes a special journey to get to a particular place. When you want to go to that one particular place, you can pull out that map to tell you exactly where to go. Whenever you want to go back to that place, all you have to do is pull out that map!**
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
- **Parameters set the positions and guidelines for the function whilst the arguments fill those positions, by the guidelines, with correlating data.**
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
- **I got through the last exercise on functions, but I am not 100 percent sure that I accomplished exactly what the prompt was asking me to do. I feel that way because of the phrase "interaction pattern" which I googled but could not find content that would help me understand. Ultimately, I decided to go with the following code. Was this correct?** 

```
function checkStock(quantity, item) {
    if (quantity >= 4 && item === "Coffee") {
      console.log(`${item} is stocked`);
    } else if (quantity <=3 && item === "Tortillas") {
      console.log(`${item} - running LOW`);
    } else if (quantity <= 0 && item === "Cheese") {
      console.log(`${item} - OUT of stock!`); 
    } else if (quantity <= 1 && item === "Salsa") {
      console.log(`${item} - running LOW`);
    }
  }
  ```
